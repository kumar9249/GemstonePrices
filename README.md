# GemstonePrices
 
Problem Statement: A company Gem Stones co. ltd., which is
a cubic zirconia manufacturer had some data containing the
prices and other attributes of almost 27,000 cubic zirconia. The
company is earning different profits on different prize slots.
The company wanted to predict the prices of gemstones on the
basis of their properties & dimensions. Also, to distinguish
between the higher profitable stones and lower profitable ones
so as to have a better profit share.

Solution: I've performed EDA & Visualization to detect any
pattern or dependency among the variables, remove any kind of
inconsistency present in the data and built a Regression model
to predict the gemstone prices
